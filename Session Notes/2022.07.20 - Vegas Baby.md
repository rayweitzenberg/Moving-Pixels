# Learning Options
## Learn C++
- Not beginner friendly in terms of how examples are presented
- Doesn't accomodate macOS/Xcode in a clear way


<br>

## freeCodeCamp
- Honestly, pretty sucky
- Presentation of content is awful
- Teachers annoying af
- Concepts aren't explained (nearly) at all


<br>

## Welcome To Game Development
https://dev.epicgames.com/community/learning/paths/OR/welcome-to-game-development

- Your First Hour in UE 5 is a decent experience


<br>

## GameDev.tv
- Pretty well structured
- Built in tandem with Epic Games
- Solid focus on C++

### I've purchased the course for both of us

<br>
<br>

# Decision based on the above
### Let's focus for now on GameDev.tv
We can layer on more intense C++ learning/experience as we go or after


### First Hour worth doing
https://dev.epicgames.com/community/learning/courses/ZpX/your-first-hour-in-unreal-engine-5/E7L/introduction-to-your-first-hour-in-unreal-engine-5

Gives a good overview of the editor interface
