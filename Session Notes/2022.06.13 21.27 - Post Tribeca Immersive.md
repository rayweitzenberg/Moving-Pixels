### NEW DOORS OF PERCEPTION: EXPLORATIONS INTO MIXED REALITY
#### Mike Tucker at Eyeo 2019
As Mixed Reality begins to break into the mainstream, artists and developers are met with a unique, new canvas to create the previously deemed impossible. Mike talks about projects he’s been involved with for Radiohead and Sigur Ros among others.

Mike Tucker is an Interactive Director at Magic Leap, a company focused on creating the future of Spatial Computing. His work explores the space of interactive arts and music. Together with the musicians Sigur Rós, they recently launched Tónandi: an audiovisual experience for Magic Leap One. He hopes to encourage the next wave of spatial designers to question our expectations of media, and the opportunity we all have in designing a mixed reality future.
